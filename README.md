## Deploy
1. Place files in repo root.
2. Create folder `imagines/` and upload `logo.png` and `truck.png`.
3. Enable GitHub Pages (main branch / root).
4. Visit `https://<username>.github.io/aerotruck-website/`.

## Notes
- Logo must have white letters on a red round mark (PNG with transparency) so it looks correct on dark background.
- Truck image must be PNG with transparent background for the hero animation.
- If you want vector logo (SVG) instead, replace `imagines/logo.png` with `imagines/logo.svg` and keep the `img` tag src updated.
