# aerotruck-website

Simple, responsive marketing website for **Aerotruck Solutions Inc.** built for GitHub Pages.

## What is included
- `index.html` – landing / hero page
- `about.html`, `services.html`, `fleet.html`, `careers.html`, `contact.html` – additional pages
- `style.css` – all styling (dark theme)
- `script.js` – small interactive behaviors (mobile nav toggle, footer year)
- `imagines/` – directory for images (`logo.png`, `truck.png`)

## How to deploy
1. Place all files in the root of your repository (or appropriate folder).  
2. Create folder `imagines` and upload `logo.png` and `truck.png` there.  
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (use `main` branch / root).  
4. Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Notes
- Image paths in the HTML refer to `imagines/logo.png` and `imagines/truck.png`.  
- If you prefer SVG for logo (recommended), replace `imagines/logo.png` with `imagines/logo.svg`.
