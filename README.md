## Quick deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Ensure all `.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` are in repo root.
2. Create `images/` folder and add image files (transparent PNGs).
3. Commit & push to `main`.
4. Settings → Pages → Source: `main` branch, Folder: `/ (root)`.
5. Wait ~1–2 minutes and open:

## Notes
- All pages use the same header & footer for consistent branding.
- Truck hero animation (and headlights) run on the home page only.
- Contact and Careers pages include forms (front-end validation + mailto fallback).
- If images appear with white background, regenerate PNGs with transparency (e.g., remove.bg) before uploading.
